# Welcome to Andre Maldonado's GitHub Page

## About Me
  I am a Boise State University alumnus with a Bachelor of Computer Science. Currently I work at
  Kount (Equifax) as a System Administrator. I'm interested in cloud techonologies such as **AWS** and **GCP**, 
  so I am always working on certification. 

  Outside of work my hobbies are playing music, soccer and biking. I play in a local punk band in the Boise 
  music scene, and also in a cover band. I've been a musician since 2010, where I started playing trumpet in 
  middle school. I kept that up all the way through my junior year at Boise State, while at the same time started 
  my band. Currently I play indoor soccer through my work, commute to work on my bike, as well as ride along the Greenbelt 
  for fun.
